# UpTube

Welcome to UpTube! This project is part of an internship program where you'll be working on building a simplified version of YouTube. Below you'll find instructions on how to get started with development, including how to run, build, and format the code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- The latest Node.js
- The latest Postgres SQL

### Installation

First, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ummahprofessionals/up-tube
cd up-tube
```

Then, install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

To start the development server, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You'll mostly need this command, as it starts Vite's development server. Open your browser and navigate to the URL provided in the terminal to see the application.

## Building

To build the project for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be output to the `dist` directory.

## Preview

To preview the production build locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm run preview
```

This will start a local server to preview the built project.

## Linting

To lint the code and check for any issues, use the following command:

```bash
npm run lint
```

This will run ESLint on the project files. Ensure that there are no linting errors before committing your code.

## Formatting

To format the codebase using Prettier, use the following command:

```bash
npm run format
```

This will automatically format the code according to the project's Prettier configuration.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`)
5. Open a pull request
