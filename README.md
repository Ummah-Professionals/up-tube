# UpTube

Welcome to UpTube! This project is part of an internship program where you'll be working on building a simplified version of YouTube. Below you'll find instructions on how to get started with development, including how to run, build, and format the code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- The latest Node.js
- The latest Postgres SQL

### Installation

First, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ummahprofessionals/up-tube
cd up-tube
```

Then, install the frontend project's dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Now go into the backend project and install its dependencies:

```bash
cd up-tube-server
npm install
```

Now you can start the backend server:

```bash
npm start
```

Now in a new terminal start the frontend server. But remember to run it from the root directory:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Go to the provided URL and see the application. To kill either server, press `CTRL+C` in your terminal.
